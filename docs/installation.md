## 2. Install the Python extension for Visual Studio Code

This extension automatically installs the [Microsoft Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) as a dependency to provide a better experience working with Python. 

- To learn more about Python in Visual Studio Code [see the docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python)
- For a walkthrough of editing, running, and debugging code, see the [Python Hello World Tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial)

> **Tip**: Check out the [IntelliCode extension for VS Code (preview)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2006060). IntelliCode provides a set of AI-assisted capabilities for IntelliSense in Python, such as inferring the most relevant auto-completions based on the current code context.

## 3. Install the Azure Machine Learning SDK

1. Open the command palette `Ctrl+Shift+P`
2. Run the `Azure ML: Install Azure ML SDK` command to install the Azure Machine Learning SDK. This will create a local private Python environment which has the Visual Studio Code prerequisites for working with Azure Machine Learning.
3. In the integrated terminal window you will be prompted to specify the Python interpreter to use, or you can simply hit **Enter** to use your default Python interpreter.
